<H1> GatorTunes: Artist Search </h1>
Welcome to GatorTunes: Artist Search, a program that allows you to search for artists based on specific categories like energy, danceability, explicit language, popularity, and genre! Here's a step-by-step guide to using the program:

### Step 1: Welcome!!!

The program will begin with a welcome message and present you with a list of categories you can filter by. Here's what you can do!

Filter by Energy: You can choose the energy level of an artist's songs (from 1 to 10).
Filter by Danceability: You can choose how danceable the artist's songs should be (from 1 to 10).
Filter by Explicit Language: You can filter for artists whose songs contain explicit language (choose between "T" for true or "F" for false).
Filter by Popularity: You can choose how popular you want the artistâ€™s songs to be (from 1 to 10).
Filter by Genre: You can choose the genre you want the artist to belong to.

### Step 2: Filter!!!

The program will prompt you to choose up to five categories you want to filter by. To do this:

1. Enter the number(s) corresponding to the categories you want to filter by (separate multiple categories with spaces)
2. The program will then ask you for the desired values for each category:
	- For Energy, Danceability, and Popularity, enter a value between 1 and 10.
	- For Explicit Language, type T for True (explicit language) or F for False (no explicit language).
	- For Genre, this will prompt you to choose a genre (though it may be a placeholder for now).

### Step 3: Get Your Results!!!

After setting your filter preferences, the program will automatically filter the list of artists accordingly.
The program will then display a list of artists that meet the chosen criteria. 
Since the dataset contains thousands of artists, the program will show only the first few that match your search. You can adjust the program to display more results if needed!!!

### Enjoy using GatorTunes: Artist Search, and have fun exploring new artists based on your personal preferences! Happy listening! ðŸŽ¶
